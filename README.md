Writing a basic C compiler in Rust.

I was following along with [Nora Sandler's "Writing A C Compiler"](https://norasandler.com/2017/11/29/Write-a-Compiler.html) series. Currently aiming to pass Week 1 tests, but currently does not work perfectly and needs to be reconfigured to emit 64-bit rather than 32-bit assembly.
